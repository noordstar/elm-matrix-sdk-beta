# Supported features in spec versions

The Matrix spec frequently releases new spec versions. Most features are
supported in the Elm SDK on most spec releases, but not all endpoints exist
for every version. For example, in very early versions you couldn't even get
the content of an event!

This document specifies which features you can expect to work for which spec
versions. This can help you decide whether the SDK will interoperate with your
homeserver, or that it may be better to not rely on a specific feature.

---

Considering that the current version does not support interaction with a
homeserver, no functionality is supported at any spec version.
