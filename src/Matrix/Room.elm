# Room

What is usually called a chat, a channel, a conversation or a group chat on
other platforms, the term used in Matrix is a "room". A room is a conversation
where a group of users talk to each other.

@docs Room, mostRecentEvents, roomId

This module exposes various functions that help you inspect various aspects of
a room.


## Account data

Account data is personal information that the user stores about this Matrix
room. This may include information like:

  - What type of room this is
  - A list of members in the room to ignore
  - A list of currently ongoing chess matches in the room
  - Personal notes the user may be taking

You may consider the account data as a `Dict String Json.Value` type. Account
data is linked to the user account: other logged in devices can see the account
data too, as the server synchronizes it, but the server shouldnÂ´t show it to
other users.

@docs getAccountData


## Sending events

Besides reading the latest events, one can also send new events to the Matrix
room. These events are JSON objects that can be shaped in any way or form that
you like. To help other users with decoding your JSON objects, you pass an
`eventType` string which helps them figure out the nature of your JSON object.
