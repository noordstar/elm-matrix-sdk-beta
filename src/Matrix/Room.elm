# Room

What is usually called a chat, a channel, a conversation or a group chat on
other platforms, the term used in Matrix is a "room". A room is a conversation
where a group of users talk to each other.

@docs Room, mostRecentEvents, roomId

This module exposes various functions that help you inspect various aspects of
a room.


## Account data

Account data is personal information that the user stores about this Matrix
room. This may include information like:

  - What type of room this is
  - A list of members in the room to ignore
  - A list of currently ongoing chess matches in the room
  - Personal notes the user may be taking

You may consider the account data as a `Dict String Json.Value` type. Account
data is linked to the user account: other logged in devices can see the account
data too, as the server synchronizes it, but the server shouldnÂ´t show it to
other users.
